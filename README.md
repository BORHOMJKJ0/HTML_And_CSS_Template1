# HTML & CSS Template — Professional Starter ✅

**A lightweight, responsive HTML & CSS starter template** for building simple static sites, landing pages, or prototypes. Clean structure, normalized styles, and an opinionated `style.css` to help you get started quickly.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd HTML_And_CSS_Template1
```

2. Preview locally:

- Open `index.html` in your browser, or
- Start a simple local server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

- (Optional) Use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code for live reload.

> Tip: If you plan to deploy, any static host (Netlify, GitHub Pages, Vercel) will work out of the box.

## 🔧 Customization

- Colors, spacing, and typography are centralized in `CSS/style.css` — adjust variables and base styles to fit your design system.
- To add custom fonts, place them in `webfonts/` and update the `@font-face` rules in `style.css`.
- Replace placeholder images in `images/` with your assets; keep aspect ratios consistent for best results.

> Note: If `all.min.css` contains a utility framework, check its docs before overriding utilities.

---

## ✅ Accessibility & Best Practices

- Use semantic HTML elements (header, main, nav, footer)
- Provide descriptive `alt` attributes for images
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability
